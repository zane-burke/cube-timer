# cube-timer

The `yew` branch is a rewrite of the original Iced program created with Yew instead. It is not fully functional yet, which is why it is not the main branch.

# Features

- Better shuffling display than the Iced version
- Better look and feel than the Iced version

# Controls

- `Space` is used for advancing through the various parts of a solve.
- `r` is used to reset things. While on the shuffle stage, it generates a new shuffle to use. On every other stage, it resets back to the shuffle generation screen.
